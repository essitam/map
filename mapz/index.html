    Minor movements are not ours to make so much as ours to attune to<br>
    - A curatorial process for the activation of minor movements requires an attunement to the conditions that select for artfulness<br>
    - An attunement to artfulness opens the work to its more-than<br>
    - The more-than is what is curated<br>
    - An environment is activated, an enlivening of an ecology<br>
    - With the enlivening comes a felt experience of time bending<br>
    - Time bending moves experience to its emergent unfolding<br>
    - In this emergent unfolding we are not spectators<br>
    - Emergent unfoldings affect the environment they co-compose<br>
    - We are part of that co-composition<br>
    - To compose a minor movement is to be composed by it<br>
    - A curatorial process for the activation of minor movements requires an active shift in the presupposition that there is a field of art and a field of life<br>
    - The political runs through the differential that is composed when the binary between art and life is undone<br>
    - What mattters is not whether it is art, but how it shifts the conditions of experience<br>
    - When art becomes the way and not the endpoint minor movements become orientors for processes to come.<br>
